# Changelog

All notable changes to MLX Guided GRPO will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-05

### Added

- **Scaffold Token Masking**: Fixed critical bug where curriculum learning and two-phase recovery tokens were incorrectly included in loss computation
  - Added `scaffold_token_counts` tracking in `generate_grpo()`
  - Added `scaffold_token_counts` parameter to `grpo_loss()`
  - Loss now correctly excludes tokens not generated by the model
  - New metrics: `scaffold_tokens_masked`, `scaffold_tokens_per_completion`

### Fixed

- Curriculum learning scaffolded tokens are now properly masked from loss
- Two-phase recovery injected tokens (e.g., `</think>\n\boxed{`) are now properly masked
- Rewards still computed on full completion text (correct behavior)

### Changed

- `_check_incomplete_completion()` now returns injected token count
- `generate_grpo()` returns 6 values instead of 5 (added `all_scaffold_token_counts`)
